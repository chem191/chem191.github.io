Arduino is an open-source platform for developing interactive electronic devices that began in 2005 as a student project at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in Ivrea, Italy. More specifically, Arduinos are microcontrollers, which are essentially small computers turn can be programmed to perform a specific task over and over again. Microcontrollers are ubiquitous in the modern world and are embedded in scientific equipment, cars, cell phones, and nearly every other electronic device. Arduino provides a simplified interface for microcontrollers and has become a very popular tool for hobby projects, citizen science tools, and even art installations. An Arduino Uno. This class will use a variant of the Arduino, called the Teensy, as described below. (image credit: Spark Fun, CC BY 2.0) Using an Arduino requires a program, or a set of commands that are uploaded to the Arduino to have it perform the desired task. In the Arduino community, the term sketch is used synonymously with program. Examples of possible programs include having the Arduino measure things like temperature, light, or humidity, or control things like lights or motors. Although the Arduino can run as a stand-alone device once setup, it must first be programmed by a computer. To program the Arduino, we’ll use the integrated development environment (IDE) available on the Arduino website. The IDE is shown in Figure 1 below. Arduino uses the computer language C–probably the most commonly used language in the world–but the IDE handles some of the programming behind the scenes to make it easier for the user. In this exercise, we’ll use an Arduino to turn a light-emitting diode (LED) on and off, and you’ll experience Arduino and the IDE firsthand. Arduino IDE showing an example program (image credit: Cedar101 [CC0], wikimedia.org) Part of the beauty of Arduino is its open-source nature. Many spin-offs and flavors of Arduino exist due to it’s open-source nature, each with its own unique benefits. In this class, we’ll use a variant of Arduino called the Teensy (specifically Teensy 3.5). The Teensy is programmed in the same way as an Arduino, but has a smaller form-factor and more capabilities than a standard Arduino. A Teensy Board, with the pin (connection) numbers and functionalities shown (reprinted from PJRC.com). This exercise will walk you through installation of the Arduino IDE, the software for the Teensy (Teensyduino), and an initial check of the board. 1.1 Install the Arduino IDE You MUST follow the order and instructions here or Teensyduino will not work! Use a web browser to navigate to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#previous. Download the installer for version 1.8.6. You must choose the installer appropriate for your operating system. Choose Just Download to download the software, or make a donation if you’re feeling generous! Open the file that downloads and run the installer. Open the Arduino program to make sure it runs and to prepare for the next steps. 1.2 Install Teensyduino Use a web browser to navigate to https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html. Download the correct installer for your operatring system. Note that steps 1 and 2 on the Teensy page should have been completed when you installed the Arduino IDE, above. Run the installer. When prompted: Select the Arduino/ folder for the install location. If Next is greyed out you probably downloaded the wrong version of the Arduino IDE. Select All when asked which additional libraries to install. 1.3 Test the Teensy! 1.3.1 Check the board Plug your Teensy into the computer via the USB connection. Be EXTREMELY careful with the USB connection on the Teensy. They break VERY easily!! You should see the orange LED blinking on the Teensy. If you do not, something is wrong with your Teensy and you should notify your instructor. 1.3.2 Check the software Open the Arduino IDE. Click File &gt; Examples &gt; 01.Basics &gt; Blink. Find the part in the program that says delay(1000) and change it to delay(500). Click Verify in the software (checkmark button in upper left corner). Press the white button on the top of the Teensy. Press upload in the software (right arrow button, next to checkmark). You should see the orange LED blink more quickly. If you encountered any errors, something could be wrong with your software installation or you may have made a typo in the code. Notify your instructor of any problems. "],
