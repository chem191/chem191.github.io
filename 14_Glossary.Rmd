# Glossary and Abbreviations {-}

### Current (*i*) {-}

The flow of electical energy, measured in **amperes (A)** or **amps** for short. By convention, current flows from the positive side of a circuit to the negative side.  [Note that the actual charge carriers, electrons, flow from the negative side the positive side!]

### Electricity {-}

A form of energy resulting from the accumulation or movement of charged particles, typically electrons.  Practically speaking, electricity is a form of energy that we use to generate heat, light, and movement.

### LED {-}

Light emitting diode; a semi-conductor designed to emit light when a current is applied.

### Power (*P*) {-}

The rate of work, measured in **Watts (W)**.  Practically speaking, power is the rate at which a circuit converts electrical energy to another form of energy (such as light).

$$
P = V i
$$

### Resistance (*R*) {-}

The resistance to current flow, measured in **ohms ($\Omega$)**.

$$
R = \frac{V}{i}
$$

### Voltage (*V*) {-}

The potential energy difference between two points in a circuit measured in **volts (V)**.  A larger voltage indicates a stronger "push" to drive electric current.
